Many competing resources available for one task (e.g. machine learning)
Why do we need such task?
Why do we choose one resource over?









For DS and ML, our goal is to create the established algorithms to develop sale prices prediction
for the time seires data.
       
Section 1: traditional, statistical methods
        - Use statsmodel decompose to identify the trends, seasonality and Noise
        - Use ARIMA methods for autoregressive integrated moving average investigation

Section 2: Machine Learning Methods
        - XGBoost
        - RandomForest Regressor

Section 3:Deep learning methods
        - Use LSTM or RNN model that has capabilities to incorporate past information for future
        predictions

We will use statsmodel, xgboost, sklearn, and tensorflow keras, for the reasons that they are well  
established, well-maintained packages.
